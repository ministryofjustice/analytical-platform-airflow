## ðŸ§ª Running Workflow Scripts Locally

This project contains utility scripts under the `scripts/` directory that support DAG development and validation.

These scripts import internal modules from the `airflow/analytical_platform` package. To ensure Python can resolve these imports, you must set the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable when running the scripts locally.


### âœ… Quick Start

1. Install project dependencies using [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):

    ```bash
    uv venv
    uv pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Run a script using PYTHONPATH=airflow:

    ```bash
    # to validate the source workflow schema
    PYTHONPATH=airflow uv run python scripts/workflow_schema_validation/main.py path/to/source/workflow.yml

    # to build the dist workflow.yml
    PYTHONPATH=airflow uv run python scripts/workflow_generator/main.py path/to/source/workflow.yml

    # to validate the dist workflow.yml
    PYTHONPATH=airflow uv run python scripts/workflow_validation/main.py path/to/dist/workflow.yml
    ```

### ðŸ“š Why PYTHONPATH Is Needed

The internal code is located under the airflow/ directory. Scripts use imports like:

    ```python
    from analytical_platform.standard_operator import AnalyticalPlatformStandardOperator
    ```

Without setting PYTHONPATH=airflow, Python will not recognise analytical_platform as a valid module, since it's nested under the airflow/ directory.


### ðŸ¤– Dev Containers and CI/CD

In development containers and GitHub Actions workflows, PYTHONPATH=airflow is already set.

You only need to configure this manually when running scripts directly on your local machine.
